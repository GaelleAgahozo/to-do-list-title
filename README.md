# To-do-list-title

## A Flutter Demo project.

* This app is created for people who want to easily remember their tasks. It has features that allow a user to add a list of their tasks and cross them out once they finish doing their tasks. 

* This app also has an additional feature that allows the user to add a title of their to-do-list app.  Let's say that a user has a number of things to do in a day and they are in different categories. First, they want to preprare a meal. Then, go to work. last, hangout with their friends. 
This app allows that user to create the title that says prepare meals and then add what they want to do. For instance, grocery shopping and cooking. Then, work: coding, visiting office hours. Lastly, hangout with friends: go to a restaurant.

* The project was created by GaÃ«lle Agahozo and it was forked from Dr. Mark Goadrich.
