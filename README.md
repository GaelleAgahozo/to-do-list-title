# To Do List

A Flutter Demo project.

## Edit Me

This aplication lets the user add new tasks that they want to accomplish, and when done, they can click on the task to mark it complete. This will be visualised through a line drawn through the task whenever the user marks it complete. Using this app, the user can also search for any task, in case they have many to do tasks and they want to make sure they have a particular one recorded, they can always us the search bar and search for the todo. The user can also choose to delete all the tasks and start afresh! this can be done by just pressing the delete icon in the appbar, which will delete everything.

Anyone, who wants to have their daily activities organised and writtedn down in a way that they can always come back to it and mark what is complete and incomplete would highly benefit from this app.
