# To Do List

A Flutter Demo project.

## Edit Me

This aplication lets the user add new tasks that they want to accomplish, and when done, they can click on the task to mark it complete. This will be visualised through a line drawn through the task whenever the user marks it complete. Using this app, the user can also search for any task, in case they have many to do tasks and they want to make sure they have a particular one recorded, they can always us the search bar and search for the todo. The user can also check their status on the button that says "Status" in the appBar. Where, when there is too many non accomplished tasks, the status button, when clicked, will be red, and when there is a fair amount of tasks to be done, the status button is green when clicked.

Anyone, who wants to have their daily activities organised and writtedn down in a way that they can always come back to it and mark what is complete and incomplete would highly benefit from this app.
